Gosh, my boyfriend and I just had a little bit of a blast talking about porn and relationships and family and stuff. Well, at least we weren't being a bit choosy by talking about sex. Haha. To be clear, I'm not saying that I don't enjoy having sex with people I know and love (I mean, I may not like the way they dress us but I think they are more fitting than our average everyday clothes) but I think it is important to remember that having sex with a person you do not know or care about is an act of sexual entitlement. It is an act of sexual entitlement that is anathema to the accepted definition of sex and should therefore not be classified as such. To make things worse for me my boyfriend and I had sex a bit later this morning and I feel extremely lucky to have had a fantastic time both physically and emotionally. I look forward to a great weekend and a warm body again Joe<|endoftext|

Gosh, I wish I were a superhero… but I am not." ~Bruce Willis in "Suicide by Design":

In case you missed it…

Suicide by Design marks the first time in the series that Bruce Wayne (Bruce Campbell) is forced to use a lethal injection (or worse) in an effort to save his (Bruce Campbell) son (Bruce Campbell)!

It may be too soon to tell what happens when the Joker (Bruce Wayne) takes over the DCU… but for now, it looks like he may be doing something right … by trying to kill Bruce Wayne (Bruce Campbell).

Get your Bruce Wayne (Bruce Campbell) X-Plane now!

Is this your normal reaction to being randomly shamed for being gay? https://t.co/A4mI9iJk7 pic.twitter.com/nKjIRvBU3z — Destructoid Australia (@DestructoidAur) December 22, 2016

It's nothing personal. I don't want to speak for everyone in the LGBTQIA+ community at large.

The pair then left the restaurant in a Rolls Royce, only to be stopped by a representative from Wageningen Airport.

The 22-year-old from Leverkusen was travelling with his girlfriend Emma and a 19-year-old boy on a hot Sunday afternoon when he was approached by a 59-year-old man in a white VW heiress polo shirt.

The man, who is not being named out of concern for his personal safety, then demanded that he give him £100 to drink.

When the worker refused to give him the money, he then told the man he’m a "dickysociopath" and would rather have sex with a rat than with a cowbell ’#Wageningen ’#Emma — Hannah
